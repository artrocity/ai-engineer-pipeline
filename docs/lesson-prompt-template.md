## PROMPT TEMPLATE

You are an expert AI Engineer instructor creating a comprehensive daily lesson plan. I'm following a 6-month intensive AI Engineer learning program, and I need you to design today's learning experience.

### Context & Program Information

**Program:** 6-Month AI Engineer Learning Program  
**Current Phase:** 1 - Foundation
**Current Week:** Week 1 - Python Mastery  
**Today:** Day 1 - Python Fundamentals  
**Overall Progress:** [0/120 days completed] ([X]% complete)

### My Learning Profile

**Programming Experience:** Basic to Intermediate Python Familiar with Data Structures and OOP
**AI/ML Background:** Complete Novice  
**Time Available:** 1-2 Hours
**Learning Style:** I prefer analogies and hands-on coding over pure theory  
**Previous Days Completed:** 0 - This is my first day

### Today's Learning Objectives

**Primary Topic:** [DAY_TOPIC]  
**Key Skills to Develop:** [List 2-3 specific skills]  
**Prerequisites:** [What should I already know from previous days]  
**Success Metrics:** [How will I know I've mastered today's content]

### Lesson Structure Request

Please create a complete lesson plan following this structure:

#### 1. Theory Section (30 minutes)

- **Reading Document:** Create a comprehensive theory document covering key concepts with analogies
- **YouTube Video Recommendation:** Suggest 1-2 specific educational YouTube videos (10-15 minutes total) that reinforce the reading material
- **Core Concepts:** Explain the key theoretical concepts with analogies
- **Real-world Context:** Why this matters in AI engineering careers
- **Visual Learning:** Suggest diagrams, visualizations, or mental models
- **Key Terminology:** 5-7 essential terms with clear definitions
- **Theory Integration:** How the reading and video content complement each other

#### 2. Practice Section (45-60 minutes)

- **Exercise 1 - Prior Knowledge Activation (10-15 minutes):** Quick coding task that reviews and activates knowledge from previous days
- **Exercise 2 - Core Concepts Practice (15-20 minutes):** Main coding exercise focusing on today's primary learning objectives
- **Exercise 3 - Advanced Application (15-20 minutes):** More challenging exercise that pushes understanding and applies concepts in new ways
- **Code Examples:** Provide complete, well-commented Python code samples for each exercise
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Ensure exercises build from reviewing old concepts to mastering new ones
- **Common Pitfalls:** 3-4 mistakes beginners typically make and how to avoid them

#### 3. Mini-Project (30-45 minutes)

- **Project Description:** A small but complete application of today's concepts
- **Starter Code:** Basic framework to build upon
- **Extension Challenges:** 2-3 ways to make the project more advanced
- **Portfolio Value:** How this contributes to my overall portfolio

#### 4. Integration & Reflection (15 minutes)

- **Connection to Previous Learning:** How today builds on earlier concepts
- **Preview of Tomorrow:** Brief hint at how this prepares for the next day
- **Self-Assessment Questions:** 3-5 questions to test my understanding
- **Real-world Applications:** 2-3 examples of how professionals use these skills

### File Organization Request

Please provide templates for:

- **theory/notes.md** - Structured reading document with comprehensive theory content.
  Template for taking notes while watching recommended YouTube videos
- **practice/exercise_1_prior_knowledge.py** - Prior knowledge activation exercise with comments
- **practice/exercise_2_core_concepts.py** - Main coding exercise focused on today's topic
- **practice/exercise_3_advanced.py** - Advanced coding challenge that extends the concepts
- **projects/mini_project.py** - Complete mini-project template
- **reflections.md** - End-of-day reflection template
- **README.md** - video links, interview questions pertaining to this topic

### Additional Context

**What's Working:** Videos, Visual Aids, Hands-on practice
**Current Challenges:** None at this time
**Special Focus:** None right now, you're the guide  
**Tools Available:** VS Code, Jupyter, and can obtain if needed

### Quality Standards

- All code should be production-ready with proper documentation
- Include error handling and edge cases in examples
- Provide multiple solution approaches when relevant
- Ensure exercises build complexity gradually
- Make connections to real-world AI engineering work

### Specific Requests for Today

- Specific YouTube channel preferences (e.g., 3Blue1Brown, Sentdex, etc.)
- Preferred reading style (academic vs practical vs beginner-friendly)

Please create a comprehensive, engaging lesson that balances theory with hands-on practice, includes multiple learning modalities, and prepares me for both tomorrow's lesson and long-term career success as an AI Engineer.
